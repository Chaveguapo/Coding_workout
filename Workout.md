Description: Create a simple React component that fetches data from an API asynchronously and displays it.

Steps:

Set up a new React project using Create React App.
Create a component that fetches data from a public API using the fetch function or axios.
Use useState to manage the fetched data and useEffect to trigger the fetch operation when the component mounts.

# Project 2: Asynchronous API Fetcher in React

Goal: Build on your async skills by creating a React application that fetches data from multiple public APIs.

Description: Create a React app that fetches and displays data from multiple APIs concurrently.

Steps:

Set up a new React project.
Create a component that fetches data from multiple APIs using Promise.all.
Manage the fetched data using useState and trigger the fetch operation using useEffect.

Create a Context for managing global state.
Fetch data asynchronously and update the Context state.
Consume the Context state in different components.

---

# Project 4: Asynchronous Form Submission

Goal: Create a form in React that submits data asynchronously to an API.

Description: Build a form that collects user data and submits it to an API asynchronously.

Steps:

Set up a new React project.
Create a form component with input fields.
Handle form submission by making an asynchronous API call.
Display the response or handle errors appropriately.

---

# Project 5: Full-fledged Asynchronous Application

Goal: Build a complete React application with multiple asynchronous components.

Description: Create a full-fledged application that fetches data from multiple APIs, handles user input, and manages state globally.

Steps:

Set up a new React project.
Create multiple components to fetch data from different APIs asynchronously.
Manage state globally using Context API or a state management library like Redux.
Handle user interactions and form submissions asynchronously.
Display the fetched data and user input results in a user-friendly interface.
